  <h1>Sumit’s JavaScript Portfolio</h1>

  <p>
    Hi there! My name is Sumit Khanal, and I am currently studying Environmental
    Geoscience and Computer Science. This portfolio will serve as a collection of
    projects I complete throughout my coursework. I enjoy learning about technology,
    problem-solving, and finding ways to apply code to real-world situations. I am
    especially interested in JavaScript, since it allows me to build interactive
    and creative web applications. My goal is to use this site as both a learning
    tool and a way to share my progress with others.
